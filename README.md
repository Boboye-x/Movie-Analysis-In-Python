# Movie-Analysis-In-Python
In this project, I did correlation analysis on a movie dataset gotten from a public data repository - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies
I employed python programming for my analysis.
I used python for data cleaning 
I hypothesized that movie budget and movie production company will have a positive relationship with movie gross earnings.
Correlation analysis revealed that only movie budget have a high positive relationship with movie gross earnings while movie production company have a low positive correlation with gross earnings.
Correlation Matrix table revealed the statistical strength between variables.
Findings reveal that movie votes also have a high correlation with movie gross earnings
